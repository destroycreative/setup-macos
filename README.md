# Setup #
Bash scripts to relieve the tedium of setting up a new macOS machine.

## Usage ##
Before proceeding, ensure the operating system is up to date. Once that is
done, clone this repository, and run the main script, as follows:

```sh
bash ./setup.sh
```

## What's covered ##
The scripts in this repository are primarily concerned with installing tools
and applications, and performing basic configuration.

More advanced tweaking and customisation is handled by separate dotfiles.

The scripts perform the following actions:

1. Install package managers.
2. Install command-line tools, applications, and fonts.
3. Set the current user's shell to ZSH.
4. Set some sensible macOS defaults.
